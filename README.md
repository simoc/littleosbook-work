Files from exercises from
[The little book about OS development](https://ordoflammae.github.io/littleosbook/)
about writing your own kernel.

This may help others who are also trying to implement the kernel.

Chapters completed so far (and tagged in git) are:

2. First Steps
3. Getting to C
4. Output

Other books and tutorials that helped me are:

- [How to make an Operating System](https://samypesse.gitbook.io/how-to-create-an-operating-system/)
